                 "Technology is evolving at such a breakneck speed that it appears to be moving faster than light! This week's hottest technology or programming language may become obsolete in the next few days! As more money is put into Research and Development, computer scientists and professionals are continually refining and upgrading existing technologies to make the most of it.Here are some of the latest trending technologies that are sure to dominate the IT industry in 2021 and the upcoming years

            </p>
            <p class="black">
                1.  Artificial Intelligence (AI):
                    Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that allows computers to make judgments in the same way that people do. When AI programs are given to systems, the goal is to replicate human intelligence for difficult tasks such as pattern identification, speech recognition, weather forecasting, and medical diagnosis, to name a few.AI automation is anticipated to provide over 70 million jobs by 2030. The sad reality is that AI might eliminate over 23 million employment in the same time frame. Jobs in fields such as testing, support, maintenance, programming, and data science will be created as a result of AI. Software developers who are familiar with AI earn far more than those who are not.
            <p class="black">
            2.  Virtual Reality (VR):
                    Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that allows you to immerse yourself in an astoundingly realistic environment. It is the creation of a simulated world using computer technology. It is often used to play video games on computers. You are directly put in the gaming world, unlike traditional games where you experience the gaming environment by seeing it on a screen.
                    These surroundings replicate the senses of touch, hearing, smell, and vision. You can move around and play the game in that 3D world using VR equipment such as headsets. The technology utilized to improve this virtual environment is called augmented reality (AR).
            <p class="black">
                3.  Data Science (
                    Data Science is, unsurprisingly, next on the list of the most recent technological topics. Data Science is a technology that aids in the interpretation of complex data. Companies produce a massive amount of data every day, as you are aware. This comprises business information, sales statistics, customer profiles, server information, and financial details.
                    The majority of this information comes in the form of large, unstructured data sets. Data scientists are responsible for converting these unstructured data sets into structured datasets. These data sets can then be examined for patterns and trends. These trends can help you better understand your company's business performance, customer retention, and how you may enhance these areas.

                Positive impact of technology:
                Whether we realize it or not, technology has a role in almost every aspect of our lives. We live in a capitalist society, which means that many new technological breakthroughs are driven by businesses wanting to improve their products-services or their capacity to market those products-services. Over time, new technology has arisen with the goal of making corporate processes more efficient and successful. Not everyone has the ability to attend college.
                Many people who would love to continue their education canâ€™t do so because they are working, taking care of families, or live too far away from their local college to be able to commute. Online classes have changed all that. Now students can enroll into online programs or take single classes without having to leave their homes and at their own convenience. While most technology has been produced for profit or to improve a company's potential to produce profit, the majority of it has been designed for the customer's benefit. When it comes down to it, however, technology simply makes day-to-day life easier. Here are a few examples of how technology has had a huge positive impact on our lives outside of the business world:
                Technology has benefited many more people and fields than just the business community. One underrated benefit of how technology has advanced over the past few decades is how it has impacted education. The society we live in today is based on technology that people have developed over thousands of years. The rapid advancement of technology has rendered life practically indistinguishable from what it was even a century ago. We are completely reliant on the technology we have. This reliance isn't just about your inability to put down your phone for more than a few hours; it's about the many technologies you probably take for granted that may have saved your life or enabled your current life without you even realizing it. There are varieties of ways how technology can benefit our physical and mental health as well.

                 Negative impact of technology:
                While some forms of technology have had great effects on the globe, there is also evidence of technology's detrimental consequences and abuse. Eye strain and difficulties focusing on crucial tasks may be caused by social media and mobile devices, which can lead to psychological and physical problems. They may also play a role in more significant health issues including depression. The overuse of technology may have a more significant impact on developing children and teenagers.
                Anyone who is unsure about the impacts of technology on them should take measures to reduce their usage of devices and screen time, as well as re-evaluate how they feel with and without them.
                Another disadvantage of technology in corporate communication is that it tends to erode interpersonal interactions in the workplace. Teams might be harmed by a lack of a collaborative environment. This could be due to the fact that employees speak largely through chat programs such as Skype rather than walking to each other's desks or picking up the phone, or it could be due to the fact that technology has improved. With fewer in-office meetings, technology allows for a more distant workforce, making it more difficult to create and sustain more in-depth professional ties.
